        <p>The history of the Negro at the
        <choice><orig>Univer-<lb break="no"/>sity</orig><reg>University</reg></choice>
        unfolds with awesome slowness. It <lb/>
        evolves over a 20-year period in which <lb/>
        court suits, financial strains and public <lb/>
        opinion gradually open the campus gates <lb/>
        to black Americans.</p>

        <p>The first Negro to attend the University <lb/>
        was <persName><forename>Donald</forename> Gaines <surname>Murray</surname></persName>. A graduate <lb/>
        of <placeName>Amherst</placeName>, <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> applied to the
        <choice>
          <orig>
            Uni-<lb break="no"/>versity

          <reg>
            University

        </choice>
        Law School in 1935. By 1936 he <lb/>
        was accepted. The year's delay in
        <persName><surname><choice><orig>Mur-<lb break="no"/>ray</orig><reg>Murray</reg></choice></surname></persName>
        's acceptance was due to a detour his <lb/>
        application took -- a detour through the <lb/>
        state <orgName>Attorney General's office</orgName> and the <lb/>
        <orgName>Circuit Court of Appeals</orgName>.</p>

        <p>In 1935, <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> was initially refused <lb/>
        admission to the University but offered <lb/>
        a scholarship to <orgName>Howard University</orgName> in <lb/>
        <placeName>Washington, D.C.</placeName>, if he were accepted <lb/>
        there. <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> declined the scholarship <lb/>
        offer, and instead sued the Board of
        <choice><orig>Re-<lb break="no"/>gents</orig><reg>Regents</reg></choice>
        for denying him admission
        <choice><orig>"be-<lb break="no"/>cause</orig><reg>because</reg></choice>
        of his color.</p>

        <p>In court, the University conceded that <lb/>
        <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> was denied admission because of <lb/>
        his race. Education in the state had
        <choice><orig>fol-<lb break="no"/>lowed</orig><reg>followed</reg></choice>
        a separate but equal, bi-racial <lb/>
        policy. Provisions for members of the <lb/>
        Negro race to be sent by scholarship to <lb/>
        professional schools outside the state <lb/>
        were made. The University President <lb/>
        <persName><forename full= "abb"> H. C.</forename> <surname>Byrd</surname></persName> further added that a
        "<choice><orig>finan-<lb break="no"/>cial</orig><reg>financial</reg></choice>
        risk" would be involved in accepting <lb/>
        Negroes, for if Negroes were admitted <lb/>
        to the state university, it was projected <lb/>
        that many students would withdraw.</p> <cb n= "1"/>


         <p>Defendant <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName>, however, contended <lb/>
         that a law education received at Howard <lb/>
         would not be equal nor comparable to a <lb/>
         law education gained at the University. <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> intended to practice law in
         <placeName><choice><orig>Bal-<lb break="no"/>timore</orig><reg>Baltimore</reg></choice></placeName>
         City, and the University legal <lb/>
         curriculum included special courses in <lb/>
         Maryland law. If he attended <orgName>oward</orgName>H, <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> felt he would be at a
         <choice><orig>disadvan-<lb break="no"/>tage</orig><reg>disadvantage</reg></choice>
         when competing in a <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> <lb/>
         court with white lawyers schooled in the <lb/>
         state.</p>

         <p>On the grounds that <persName>Murray</persName> had been <lb/>
         denied admission to the University <lb/>
         due only to the color of his skin, a violation <lb/>
           of the <name type="law">Fourteenth Amendment</name> was
         <choice><orig>de-<lb break="no"/>clared</orig><reg>declared</reg></choice>
         by the Court. <persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName> was
         ad- mitted
         to the University's Law School in <lb/>
         fall, 1936.</p>

         <p><title>Three Negroes by 1936</title></p>

         <p><persName><surname>Murray</surname></persName>'s bold and successful court <lb/>
         fight signalled the start of other Negro <lb/>
         advances to the gates of the University. <lb/>
         The law school began receiving--and <lb/>
         accepting--other Negro applications, and <lb/>
         by 1939 there were three Negroes
         <choice><orig>at-<lb break="no"/>tending</orig><reg>attending</reg></choice>
         law classes in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>.<lb/></p>

         <p>Although the law school now had an <lb/>
         integrated admissions policy, for the next <lb/>
         15 years all other branches of the
         <choice><orig>Uni-<lb break="no"/>versity</orig><reg>University</reg></choice>
         remained segregated. In 1946 and <lb/>
         again in 1949, the <orgName>School of Pharmacy</orgName> <lb/>
         denied admission to Negro applicants. <lb/>
         Several Negroes applying to
         <choice><orig>under-<lb break="no"/>graduate</orig><reg>undergraduate</reg></choice>
         classes in <placeName>College Park</placeName> were <lb/>
         also refused enrollment.<lb/></p>

        <p>The University's admissions policy <lb/>
        was clearly bi-racial: Negro profes- <cb n= "2"/>


         sional and graduate students were
         <choice><orig>re-<lb break="no"/>ferred</orig><reg>referred</reg></choice>
         to out-of-state institutions on <lb/>
         scholarship; and undergraduate

         were rejected and steered

         <orgName>Morgan State</orgName> and <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> <lb/>
         Colleges. </p>

         <p><title><orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> embodied</title></p>

         <p><orgName>Morgan</orgName> and <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> were two <lb/>
         state-owned Negro institutions. <orgName>Morgan</orgName> <lb/>
         operates apart from the University. <lb/>
         <orgName>Princess Ann</orgName> was incorporated into the <lb/>
         University in 1935 to comply with a
         <choice><orig>sec-<lb break="no"/>tion</orig><reg>section</reg></choice>
         on Negro education in the <orgName>Land Grant <lb/>
           College</orgName>. <name type="law">(The Morrill Act.)</name></p>

         <p>This statute required that a share of <lb/>
         land-grant allocations go to Negroes. <lb/>
         By both annexing and recognizing
         <orgName><choice><orig>Prin-<lb break="no"/>cess</orig><reg>Princess</reg></choice>
         Anne</orgName> as a land-grant college for <lb/>
         colored students, the University could <lb/>
         continue to receive Federal funds granted <lb/>
         under the act.</p>

         <p><title>Negro institution ignored</title></p>

         <p>With <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> a port of the
         <choice><orig>Uni-<lb break="no"/>versity</orig><reg>University</reg></choice>
         , a special fiscal policy was
         <choice><orig>de-<lb break="no"/>vised</orig><reg>devised</reg></choice>
          for the <orgName>Eastern Shore college</orgName>. <lb/>
         Money was to be distributed
         <choice><orig>proportion-<lb break="no"/>ately</orig><reg>proportionately</reg></choice>
         , on the basis of state population, <lb/>
         between the white and Negro branches of <lb/>
         the school. Initially, $210,000 was poured <lb/>
         into <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName>. Over the next decade <lb/>
         however, the Negro institution was more or less ignored.<lb/></p>

         <p>In 1947 an investigation of <orgName>Princess <lb/>
         Anne</orgName> was released by the <orgName>Marbury
         <choice><orig>Com-<lb break="no"/>mission</orig><reg>Commision</reg></choice></orgName>
         . In its final report, the Com- <cb n= "3"/>


         mission described the institution as a <lb/>
         "Jim-Crow school." Plumbing was
         <choice><orig>de-<lb break="no"/>ficient</orig><reg>deficient</reg></choice>
         , dormitories inadequate and many <lb/>
         buildings were of "indefinite origin." <lb/>
         Academically, the institution was only a <lb/>
         shadow of a college; it was unaccredited, <lb/>
         its faculty was small, its enrollment had <lb/>
         never surpassed 159 and half of the
         <choice><orig>stu-<lb break="no"/>dent</orig><reg>student</reg></choice>
         body came from out of state.<lb/></p>

         <p>The Commission concluded that
         <orgName><choice><orig>Prin-<lb break="no"/>cess</orig><reg>Princess</reg></choice>
         Anne</orgName> had proved unsuccessful as a <lb/>
         Negro institution. It was recommended <lb/>
         that <orgName>Morgan State College</orgName>, the accredited <lb/>
         Negro school in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, assume
         <choice><orig>con-<lb break="no"/>trol</orig><reg>control</reg></choice>
         of <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName>. <orgName>Morgan State</orgName>, the <lb/>
         Commission felt, had greater resources <lb/>
         and its location would attract more Negro <lb/>
         undergraduates than the <orgName>Somerset County <lb/>
         school</orgName> had.</p>

         <p><title><persName>Byrd</persName> opposed to change</title></p>

         <p>This recommendation was received <lb/>
         like a bomb by University President <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>. A two-year fight began between <lb/>
         <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>, the <orgName>State Legislature</orgName> and the
         com- munity
         . <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName> wanted to keep <orgName>Princess <lb/>
         Anne</orgName> in his domain. He made sweeping <lb/>
         promises to the Negro populace
         concern- ing
         the potential of <orgName>rincess Anne</orgName>. He <lb/>
         proposed to the legislature a four million <lb/>
         dollar appropriation to rebuild and
         re- vitalize
         the <orgName full="abb">Eastern Shore</orgName> facilities.<lb/></p>

         <p>At hearings, <persName><surname>Byrd</surname></persName>'s opponents noted <lb/>
         that the University had incorporated <lb/>
         <orgName>Princess Anne</orgName> in 1936 but had "failed <lb/>
         to perform its duty." A Baltimore Sun <cb n= "4"/></p>
       </div>


         <div><p>editorial called Princess Anne "a <lb/>
         kind of Cinderella to the Univer- <lb/>
         sity." Byrd's effort to sustain <lb/>
         the institution, stated the Sun, <lb/>
         was an effort to stop "a threat <lb/>
         to part of his domain, not a sin- <lb/>
         cere effort for the welfare of the <lb/>
         Negro community. Furthermore, <lb/>
         Byrd's move to pour four million <lb/>
         dollars into the college was a <lb/>
         plan to "so deeply commit the <lb/>
         State "to the development of Prin- <lb/>
         cess Anne, that there could be no <lb/>
         withdrawal.</p>

         <p>Despite oratory, petitions, <lb/>
         hearings and editorials in op- <lb/>
         position to Byrd, the president's <lb/>
         wheeling and dealing in Annapo- <lb/>
         lis brought victory to his propos- <lb/>
         al. In 1949 the Legislature appro- <lb/>
         priated $300,000 to the Negro <lb/>
         institution, indicating con- <lb/>
         fidence in Byrd's continued <lb/>
         administration of Princess Anne. <lb/>
         With this and subsequent appro- <lb/>
         priations, Byrd slowly augmented
           <cb n= "5"/>


         Princess Anne-'s faculty and fa- <lb/>
         cilities.</p>

         <p>While the Princess Anne issue <lb/>
         was debated, the University's <lb/>
         "separate but equal, bi-racial <lb/>
         philosophy pervaded its dealings. <lb/>
         In 1947, a Negro Air Force <lb/>
         veteran, Major Wilmore B. <lb/>
         Leonard, had registered for <lb/>
         graduate study in College Park. <lb/>
         At first he was "provisionally" <lb/>
         accepted. Later, through, he <lb/>
         was rejected.</p>

         <p><title>Rejected due to grades</title></p>

         <p>Protesting, the veteran was <lb/>
         told that the University was re- <lb/>
         jecting all students accepted <lb/>
         "provisionally" that year. (Pro- <lb/>
         visional status indicated that oth- <lb/>
         er applicants had better academic <lb/>
         records.) Due to overcrowding <lb/>
         in the school, students accepted <lb/>
         on provisional bases were, at <lb/>
         later dates, all rejected.</p>

         level lay dormant for some time <lb/>
         after Leonard's inquiry. The <lb/>
         following summer, however, <lb/>
         found Byrd facing NAACP picket <lb/>
         lines in the newspapers.</p>

         <p><title>Summer courses offered</title></p>

         <p>In an effort to keep College <lb/>
         Park white, the University was <lb/>
         offering summer courses for <lb/>
         Negro teachers at Douglas High <lb/>
         School in Baltimore. The <lb/>
         NAACP, angered that the Univer- <lb/>
         sity was equating Douglas's fa- <lb/>
         cilities with those at College <lb/>
         Park, organized a picket line on <lb/>
         registration day.</p>

         <p>Only two students dared to <lb/>
         cross the line drawn by hundreds <lb/>
         of placard-carrying marchers. <lb/>
         The students, both Negro teach- <lb/>
         ers, registered and took summer <lb/>
         courses.</p>

         <p>All summer long a verbal bat- <lb/>
         tle was waged between the NAACP <lb/>
         the Afro-American Newspaper <lb/>
         and Byrd. The Afro-American-- <lb/>
         which parenthetically noted that <lb/>
         Dr. Byrd's title referred to an <lb/>
         honorary doctorate degree in <lb/>
         philosophy--maintained that the <lb/>
         Douglas classes were "ludi- <lb/>
         crous." For two students, the <lb/>
         University was employing three <lb/>
         teachers and one librarian.</p>

         <p><title>'Controlled segregation'</title></p>

         <p>Unabashed, Byrd replied by <lb/>
         emphasizing that the State of <lb/>
         Maryland's education policy was <lb/>
         one of "controlled segregation." <lb/>
         Following the hectic summer <lb/>
         session, the <orgName=>NAACP found itself <lb/>
         defending Martin B. Booth, a <lb/>
         Negro applicant to the Maryland <lb/>
         School of Pharmacy. Booth had <lb/>
         applied to the school in May of <lb/>
         1948 and had been rejected on <lb/>
         the grounds that "the school has <lb/>
         filled its quota." However, on <lb/>
         August 14 of that same year, <lb/>
         Booth reapplied for admission <lb/>
         the next, or any succeeding se- <lb/>
         mester.</p>
         <cb n= "7"/>


         <p>This time the University re- <lb/>
         fused to pass on the Negro's ap- <lb/>
         plication. Demanding some ac- <lb/>
         tion, Booth went to court, claiming <lb/>
         that the original "rejection was <lb/>
         based not on the time of his ap- <lb/>
         plication, but because of his race <lb/>
         or color."</p>

         <p>In newspaper statements, Byrd <lb/>
         responded to Booth's accusation. <lb/>
         "We haven't turned down anybody <lb/>
         in any school on the basis of <lb/>
         his being a Negro," he said, explain- <lb/>
         ing that the University refers <lb/>
         Negroes to Negro institutions.</p>

         <p><title>Lost in litigation</title></p>

         <p>Booth's case was apparently <lb/>
         lost somewhere on the litigation <lb/>
         ladder. The only further public <lb/>
         record on the matter is a nota- <lb/>
         tion in the Board of Regents <lb/>
         minutes of Sept. 24, 1948. It was <lb/>
         stated that "future actions" on <lb/>
         Booth's application would be "on <lb/>
         the advice of the (State's) attorney <lb/>
         general."</p>

         <p>The summer of 1949 abounded <lb/>
         in suits brought against the Uni- <lb/>
         versity by Negro applicants. One <lb/>
         applicant to the <orgName>School of Phar- <lb/>
         macy</orgName> and two for the <orngName>School of <lb/>
           Dentistry</orgName> alleged that race was <lb/>
         the sole reason for their rejec- <lb/>
         tions. A home economics student <lb/>
         and an engineering undergraduate <lb/>
         were refused admission to under- <lb/>
         graduate studies at College Park.</p>

         <p>A total of six suits were brought <lb/>
         against the University, and the <lb/>
         Board of Regents replied to them <lb/>
         by stating that the University had <lb/>
         a "general policy of segregation. <lb/>
         Separate but equal facilities" <lb/>
         were provided for Negro appli- <lb/>
         cants who were state citizens.</p>

         <p> <title>Out-of-state scholarships</title></p>

         <p>In reply to the court order of<lb/>
         mandamus, the University of- <lb/>
         fered the six Negroes admis- <lb/>
         sion into Morgan State or Prin- <lb/>
         cess Anne, or scholarships to <lb/>
         out-of-state schools.</p>

         <p>Provisions for out-of-state <lb/>
         scholarships were arranged by <lb/>
         the University in conjunction with <lb/>
         the Southern Regional Compact. <lb/>
         This compact was composed of <lb/>
         14 Southern states which pooled <lb/>
         their educational facilities. When <lb/>
         certain programs were lacking in <lb/>
         one state, resources from another <lb/>
         state could be used.</p>

         <p>Up until 1949, the Regional <lb/>
         Contracts had been, in total, <lb/>
         awarded to 18 Negroes and 217 <lb/>
         whites. The Compact was not <lb/>
         viewed as a means for thwarting <lb/>
         integration.</p>

         <p>In 1949, however, local groups <lb/>
         in Maryland charged that the Uni- <lb/>
         versity' by settling mandamus <lb/>
         suits with out-of-state scholar- <lb/>
         ship offers' was using the region- <lb/>
         al compact to evade equal educa- <lb/>
         tion statutes.</p>

         <p><title>Scholarship refused</title></p>

         <p>Eighteen year old Esther Mc- <lb/>
         Cready, who had applied to the <lb/>
         Maryland School of Nursing, re- <lb/>
         fused a scholarship to MeHarry <lb/>
         Medical College in Nashville, <lb/>
         Tenn. Miss McCready claimed <lb/>
         that she could not be required to <lb/>
         go out of her state to receive <lb/>
         education available at home. Ask- <lb/>
         ing her to leave the state due to <lb/>
         her race was denying her con- <lb/>
         stitutional rights under the Four- <lb/>
         teenth Amendment.</p>

         <p>The University, however, felt <lb/>
         it had "discharged its constitu- <lb/>
         tional obligation to afford equal
         <cb n= "8"/>

         education opportunities* by of- <lb/>
         fering the applicant a scholarship <lb/>
         to MeHarry. In court it was even <lb/>
         brought out that MeHarry was a <lb/>
         school whose facilities were "su- <lb/>
         perior" to Maryland's.</p>

         <p>A lower court upheld the con- <lb/>
         tention of the University. But the <lb/>
         Maryland Circuit Court of Ap- <lb/>
         peals reversed this decision. <lb/>
         Miss McCready's rights had in- <lb/>
         deed been denied.</p>

         <p>Referring to State of Missouri <lb/>
         ex-rel. Gaines v. Canada, the <lb/>
         Court held that a scholarship to <lb/>
         MeHarry "did not relieve the <lb/>
         state of its responsibility to pro- <lb/>
         vide equal opportunities for Ne- <lb/>
         groes within the boundaries of <lb/>
         the State. By no rational means <lb/>
         could the State extend its boun- <lb/>
         daries to Nashville, Tenn.</p>

         <p><title>Court orders admission</title></p>

          <p>The Court further held that the <lb/>
          "regional compact cannot be used <lb/>
          to maintain a segregated system <lb/>
          of higher education." Miss Mc-<lb/>
          Cready's admission to the Mary- <lb/>
          land School of Nursing was or- <lb/>
          dered.</p>

          <p>Still fighting for its segregation <lb/>
          policy, the University appealed <lb/>
          this decision to the Supreme <lb/>
          Court. The High Court, however, <lb/>
          denied certiori, and the issue was <lb/>
          settled. Miss McCready became <lb/>
          the first Negro to attend the <lb/>
          Nursing School.</p>

          <p>The implications of the case <lb/>
          were clear. The University would <lb/>
          have to make its Negro Institu- <lb/>
          tions parallel to its white insti- <lb/>
          tutions or begin admitting Ne- <lb/>
          groes to College Park and to all <lb/>
          Baltimore professional schools.</p>

          <p>Byrd and the Legislature sup- <lb/>
          ported the former alternative, <lb/>
          i.e. a "dual school system" over <lb/>
          an integrated one. For several <lb/>
          years, new programs were in- <lb/>
          stituted and more funds were <lb/>
          poured into Princess Anne. How- <lb/>
          ever, court litigations' were now <lb/>
          travelling at a pace faster than <lb/>
          the State's educational budget.</p>

          <p><title>College Park tested</title></p>

          <p>In 1951 Hiram T. Whittle, a 20 <lb/>
          year old Negro who wished to <lb/>
          transfer from Morgan State into <lb/>
          the College Park engineering <lb/>
          program, received a writ of <lb/>
          mandamus admitting him to the <lb/>
          University. The State's attorney <lb/>
          general advised the Board of Re- <lb/>
          gents to accept Whittle since <lb/>
          College Park housed the only <lb/>
          state supported engineering fa- <lb/>
          cilities In Maryland.</p>

          <p>Whittle thereby set several <lb/>
          precedents. He was the first <lb/>
          Negro admitted to the University <lb/>
          without a court battle--though he <lb/>
          did follow in the wake of the Mc- <lb/>
          Cready storm. He was also the <lb/>
          first Negro to attend classes in <lb/>
          the College Park campus and to <lb/>
          live in a white dormitory.</p>

          <p>At this same time, another <lb/>
          Negro student was pushing his <lb/>
          way through the Courts. Parren <lb/>
          J. Mitchell, a graduate student <lb/>
          in sociology, had applied to the <lb/>
          University in August of 1950. <lb/>
          Mitchell was accepted with the <lb/>
          tacit understanding that he attend <lb/>
          classes in Baltimore--not in Col- <lb/>
          lege Park.</p>
